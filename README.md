- The `AC` button clears the input field.
- The `DEL` button deletes the last character from the input field.
- The `/`, `*`, `-`, and `+` buttons represent division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition, respectively.
- To perform a calculation, enter a mathematical expression and click on the `=` button. The result will be displayed in the input field.

## Customization

You can customize the calculator's appearance and behavior by modifying the CSS and JavaScript files (`style.css` and `index.js`).

## CSS Customization

The calculator's appearance is defined by the CSS styles in the `style.css` file. You can modify the following aspects:

- Font: The calculator uses the "Quicksand" font from Google Fonts. You can change the font by modifying the `font-family` property in the CSS.
- Colors: The calculator's background and button colors are defined by linear gradients. You can modify the gradient colors by changing the hexadecimal color codes in the CSS.
- Sizes: You can adjust the size of the calculator, buttons, and input field by modifying the `width`, `height`, and `font-size` properties in the CSS.
